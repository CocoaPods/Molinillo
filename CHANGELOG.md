# Molinillo Changelog

## 0.2.0

* Institute stricter forward checking by backjumping to the source of a
  conflict, even if that source comes from the existing spec. This further
  improves performance in highly conflicting situations when sorting heuristics
  prove misleading.

  [Samuel Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins)

##### Bug Fixes

  messaging `nil`.
